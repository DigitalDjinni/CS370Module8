Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
When it comes to this project I was given starter code that set up the game environment, as well as the basic framework for reinforcement learning. The code I had to create myself was that of the Q-learning algorithm used for the pirate agent. This involved me creating the neural network to approximate Q-values, and setting up the training process to improve the agents learning capabilities. 
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
This course reinforced the fact that computer scientists develop algorithms and software to automate tasks like analyzing data and creating intelligent agents. They solve problems by breaking them down, then designing solutions like I did when I created the pirate agents Q-algorithm 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems as a computer scientist by first reading the documentation and understanding what the problem is fully. Then I break down this problem into pseudocode and try to implement a function bit by bit testing it along the way. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are ensuring that the software is safe and reliable and that it respects the users privacy. For organizations, solutions must be built to meet users needs that also align with their values. In this project I had to develop a fair AI agent that enhanced the game experience while holding ethical standards.
